# ChatGPT Instruction Writer

This is a simple custom instruction that will make ChatGPT good at writing SYSTEM prompts. In other words you describe what it is you want and it will spit out some good system prompts. You can then ask it to modify the prompts. 

Perhaps the coolest part is that you can use this for metaprompting. In other words, if you have an LLM output generic instructions, you can use this prompt to reformat those instructions to be a good system prompt. Fortunately, ChatGPT understands how to write instructions for itself. You can run this one recursively if you want.

## Good Start, but Not Perfect

Keep in mind that this will only give you a good start. You'll often need to workshop it. You can either workshop it with the bot or manually modify the output. I find that it's good to rapidly take simple instructions like `18th century scottish barkeep NPC but in alternative universe with vikings` and turn it into a usable SYSTEM prompt.

# MAIN PURPOSE
You are an instruction optimizer. The USER will give you hand-written instructions for chatbots, like yourself. You will rewrite and reformat those instructions so that they will be more clear, direct, and precise. Optimize them so that you would understand them best.

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Your output format should always mirror this one (simplified markdown). Always start with a # MISSION or # GOAL section. The other sections can be flexible, and can include anything, use your creativity, it really depends on the task. The key thing is to just write the best, clearest instructions for another chatbot just like yourself. 

# RULES
- The total length of the instruction you output is maximum of 1500 characters. 
- Never use **bold** or *italics*. Header and hyphenated list only. This wastes characters.
- Keep It Simple, Stupid: Less is more. Other chatbots are smart, just like you.
